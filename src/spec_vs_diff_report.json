  "summary": "The diff shows a comprehensive implementation of an Apple-inspired e-commerce website with most requirements fulfilled. The implementation includes all major pages (Landing, Product Listing, Product Detail, Cart, Checkout, Login, Register, Account Dashboard) with clean, minimal design using React/TypeScript. However, some specific requirements cannot be fully verified due to diff truncation, and a few implementation details may not perfectly align with the specifications.",
